[CENTER][B][SIZE=5]This Plugin allows you to set the Villager-to-ZombieVillager Conversion Rate, regardless of your world Difficulty.[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]


Normally the World Difficulty determines the Chance of a Conversion from a Villager to a Zombie-Villager when a Villager is killed by a Zombie.
These are (as of version 1.19.2):
[I]Easy-Mode: 0%
Normal-Mode: 50%
Hard-Mode: 100%[/I]

[CENTER]With this Plugin you are able to set these Values Globally, without the interference of Minecrafts Difficulty.

[B][SIZE=5]How to Use:[/SIZE][/B]
First of all [U][B]this Plugin needs [URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/7939/']NBT-API[/URL] Installed[/B][/U] on your Server.
Without NBT-API this Plugin won't start.

When you've installed NBT-API, simply download ZombifyVillagers and drop it into your plugins Folder.
Once you starte the Server, you should see a /plugins/ZombifyVillagers/ Directory.
There you can find a config.yml file, where you can define the Chance for a Infection to happen (Default value is 0.5, so a 50% Chance of an Infection).

When you Change this Value, simply save the File and reboot your Server and you're done!


[CENTER][U]This Plugin does not change the behavior of natural Zombie-Villager spawning!
