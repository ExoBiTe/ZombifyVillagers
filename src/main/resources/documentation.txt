[CENTER][B][SIZE=5]This Plugin allows you to set the Villager-to-ZombieVillager Conversion Rate, regardless of your world Difficulty.[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]


Normally the World Difficulty determines the Chance of a Conversion from a Villager to a Zombie-Villager when a Villager is killed by a Zombie.
These are (as of version 1.19.2):
[I]Easy-Mode: 0%
Normal-Mode: 50%
Hard-Mode: 100%[/I]

[CENTER]With this Plugin you are able to set these Values Globally, without the interference of Minecraft's Difficulty.
